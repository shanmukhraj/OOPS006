Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between 1 and 10, and we search for 5.
Which sequence below cannot be the sequence of keys examined? Why?
a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 3, 5
c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5
d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5
e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5

Solution:
The sequence b and d are not applicable.

Because in option 'b' we cannot visit 3 and in option 'd' we cannot visit 8.
