Is the following implementation of hashCode() is legal?

public int hashCode(){
    return 17;
}
If legal analyze the performance.

Yes the implementation is legal but it is a poor hash function. The reason it is poor hash function is because there will be lot
of memory wastage and there will be more collisions as every key we insert will be at '17th' index.
